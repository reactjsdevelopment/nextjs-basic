| pages -> homepage -> The Pages Router has a file-system based router built on concepts of pages. When a file is added to the pages directory it's automatically available as a route. 
| | posts
| | api
| | | | hello.js
| | | first-post
| | tailwind
| | _app -> define the global layout -> Custom App
| | _document -> to control the initial response from the server -> Custom Document
| | calculator -> another calorie route
| | signin -> another  route
| | signup -> another  route
_error	.js .jsx .tsx	Custom Error Page
404	.js .jsx .tsx	404 Error Page
500	.js .jsx .tsx	500 Error Page

http://localhost:3000/tailwind 
The router will automatically route files named index to the root of the directory.

Layout Pattern ->  The React model allows us to deconstruct a page into a series of components. Many of these components are often reused between pages. For example, you might have the same navigation bar and footer on every page.   <main>{children}</main>
